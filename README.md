# WorkNest-Supply-Performance-Dashboard-by--progress (MS Excel Dashboard)
## Project Overview  
When I first looked at the WorkNest Supplies dataset, it was messy. There were duplicates, missing values, inconsistent dates, and scattered codes that didn’t make much sense.  
My task was to take this cluttered sheet as a Junior Data Analyst and turn it into something that could actually help a manager understand the business.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project can be found here:  
📊 **[Dataset](https://github.com/progressuchenwa/WorkNest-Supply-Performance-Dashboard-by--progress/blob/main/WorkNest%20Supplies%20Dataset.xlsx)**

## Cleaning and Organizing the Data  
I started by making a copy of the raw data so the original stayed intact. From there, I cleaned it step by step:  
- Removed duplicates and blank rows.  
- Formatted text and dates so everything was consistent.  
- Used VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP to pull in missing customer names and product details.  
By the end of this, the dataset looked cleaner and much easier to work with.  

## Creating Useful Metrics  
The raw numbers on their own didn’t tell much, so I built new calculated columns to answer business questions. For example:  
- How much revenue did we actually earn after discounts?  
- How fast were orders being shipped?  
- Which orders counted as high value?  
These calculations helped turn the sheet into something a manager could use to spot trends.  

## Building the Dashboard  
Once the data was ready, I created PivotTables and charts, then brought them together into an interactive Excel dashboard.  
I also added slicers so you could filter by Region or Customer Segment and see the charts update instantly.  

The dashboard showed:  
- Sales by region (East was the top performer).  
- Sales by product category (Technology was strongest, especially Office Machines).  
- Orders by state, highlighting the top 4.  
- Monthly sales trends.  
- Key figures like total revenue, number of orders, best-selling product, and average shipping days.

## 🔍 What I Found  
A few clear patterns stood out:  
- The East region was driving the most revenue.  
- Technology products — especially Office Machines — sold the best.  
- Saturday was the strongest sales day.  
- Shipping was quick, with an average of 2 days from order to delivery.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters  
This project showed me how much impact simple Excel tools can have. Starting with a dataset that looked confusing and messy, I was able to clean it, create useful measures, and build a dashboard that gave real insights.  

It turned raw numbers into a story about where the company earns the most, what products drive sales, and how fast customers receive their orders.
